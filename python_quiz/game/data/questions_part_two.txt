Which of the follow is not an implementation of python:IronPython:PyPy:Jython:Jetpy:4
All built-in non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from which class:Exception:BaseException:ArithmeticError:BufferError:1
When raising (or re-raising) an exception in an except or finally clause dunder context is automatically set to which context:the global context:the module's context:the last exception caught you are able to set:the thread local context:3
What year was the first release of Python:1992:1987:1995:1991:4
Which of the following is a kind of date and time object:naive:self-aware:unaware:relative:1
In the time module what does epoch mean:the first day of the year:the last day of the year:the point where time is considered to start:the time since the python progam has started:3
What does the builtin function dunder import do:It reloads all modules in the local namespace:imports the module from the supplied argument of name:it is abstract and meant to be implemented in a concrete subclass:nothing:2
What does the builtin function zip do:Concatenates two lists into an immutable tuple:creates a python package:creates a zipfile:makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables:4
When does the iterator for the builtin function zip stop:When the shortest input iterable is exhausted:when the longest input iterable is exhausted:when you tell the iterator to stop:it does not stop:1
What is an alternative to zip when you have unmatched iterable lengths:zip_guaranteed:zip_ensured:zip_longest:zip_all:3
What does the builtin function vars do:Returns the signature of the function passed in:Returns the dunder dict attribute if it's available:Returns the dunder vars attribute if its available:Returns the current readable objects in the namespace:2
What is the purpose of the the dunder dict attribute:A dictionary for storing all of the dictionaries used:a dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object's writable attributes:a dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object's readable attributes:it is abstract and will raise if used:2
What does the built in function type do when passed one argument which is an object:Returns the type of an object:Returns the name of the concrete class of the object:Returns the name of the abstract class of the object:Returns the memory location of the built in type:1
What does the built in function type do when passed three arguments of name, bases, and dict:Returns the name of the concrete class of the name:Returns the abstract class of the name:Returns a new type object:Returns whether the dict it mutable based on the name and bases:3
What does the built in function sum do when passed a single argument consisting of an iterable:Sums the memory locations of the iterables:Sums the iterable from left to right and returns the total:Sums the iterable from right to left and returns the total:Sums the iterable from right to left and stores the value on the dunder add attribute of the global object:2
What does the built in function slice do when passed three arguments of start, stop, and step:Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by the start, stop, and step:Returns a tuple containing information from the start, stop, and step:Returns a dictionary with keys start stop and step containing information pertaining to each:Returns an iterable from start to stop with the given step:1
What is an alternative to the built in slice function that returns an iterator:itertools dot islice:itertools dot sliceiter:itertools dot generateslices:it does not exist:1
